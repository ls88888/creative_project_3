# creative_project_3

<h2> Requirements </h2>
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

The site uses Vue and the Vue CLI
The site has at least three pages
The site has some mock data that is at least as detailed as the mock data used in the prior lab.
The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account and should be a public repository.

<h2> Submission </h2> 
Please submit to Canvas the URL for your web server, where your code is running (e.g. on your DigitalOcean server). On this website, in a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository. Use a unique URL for the project, e.g. cp3.emmasmith.org.

If you worked with a pair programming partner, both of you should submit the assignment and both of you should list the other person's name in the website footer and in the assignment submission.

<h2> Rubric for Grading </h2>
We will grade your projects based on:

you used Vue and the Vue CLI for the entire site
you have three pages
you have detailed mock data
how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.
TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

90-100: Excellent use of Vue, clearly follows web design principles
80-90: Uses Vue, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue, but does not make a strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles
